		<p>When the Treasury Department ordered the Direct File team to stop work and disband, the toughest part was saying goodbye.</p>
<p>Direct File deserves an <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em>-style montage for assembling the team. The old partner who had to be convinced to come back for one more job (the best, and perpetually most reluctant, user experience lead in the business). The loose cannon I was wary of bringing onto the team due to a checkered past (a brilliant engineer with a crypto startup on his resume). The whiz kid with the precise set of skills needed to pull off the plan (an interaction designer by training, she and I had studied up on tax law together, and she took to it like a fish to water).</p>
<p>We came together, a band of misfits and weirdos, under the banner of a fantastical, improbable mission. It felt like we were unstoppable. And then we were stopped.</p>
<p>And as much as we had accomplished, we knew we were just getting started. So we did our best to document what we had learned. We prepared the project for hibernation, writing notes for a future team that might never come. We said goodbye.</p>
<p>It was August 2022.</p>
<hr>
<p>It wasn’t Direct File’s first death. By my count it was the second, although there’s an argument for it being the third. Neither count includes all of the doomed attempts to tilt at this particular windmill over the two and a half decades before we took up the lance.</p>
<p>During the initial policy process<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-saying-goodbye-1" id="fnref-saying-goodbye-1">[1]</a></sup> on Direct File in 2021, I had argued that we would need to make a go/no go decision by June 2022 in order to have the best shot at success in filing season 2024, the final filing season of the Biden administration. And so when the policy process was reconstituted in early 2022, we were told our goal would be to prepare options and recommendations for a June decision. But by May, it was clear that we were going to blow that deadline.</p>
<p>So Merici Vinton, my U.S. Digital Service (USDS) project co-lead, and I hatched a plan. We asked to use our small USDS team to build a “proof of concept.” This prototype<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-saying-goodbye-2" id="fnref-saying-goodbye-2">[2]</a></sup> of Direct File would illustrate some of the key issues being discussed in the policy process and develop an evidence base to inform future strategy. It would build momentum ahead of a decision, enabling us to hit the ground running if and when that decision came. I said the words “preserving optionality” a lot.</p>
<p>It was also, and everyone knew it, an advocacy tool. As Merici put it, she wanted something so self-evidently good that it would “make it hurt” when decision makers declined to give Direct File the green light. And so a team of three designers and four engineers (if you count me despite splitting time between coding, memos, and meetings), built a proof of concept version of Direct File in eight weeks.</p>
<p>Seizing an opportunity to grow the expertise and capacity of the team was an under-appreciated benefit of this work. Even from this early stage, the product was designed alongside users, and these early insights from taxpayers helped shape our intuitions. The proof of concept served as a laboratory to try out ideas and as a springboard for future iterations. We made mistakes, and learned from them (whatever you do, don’t try to express the logic of the Internal Revenue Code as YAML). The team developed a shared vocabulary, critical for collaboration between disciplines, which the reluctant user experience lead termed our <em>tax</em>onomy. And then there were the inside jokes, and the fridge magnets, and the Pictionary games.</p>
<p>At the end of the eight weeks, we not only had a version of a Direct File, but we had a close-knit group of people who knew how to build a Direct File. Because they had done it.</p>
<hr>
<p>We began to strategize about what to do next with our small but mighty team. But then the administration’s climate and tax bill, thought dead, was suddenly accelerating toward becoming law. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), as it was now titled, would give the IRS an additional $80 billion over ten years. What should have been very good news for Direct File unexpectedly spelled its demise.</p>
<p>The decision was made within Treasury, so I can’t speak to the deliberations that occurred. The stated rationale was that with the imminent passage of the IRA, the IRS was ready to take on Direct File without outside help, and that the effort would be best managed as part of the emerging IRA strategic process. Instead of handing off the work in progress, however, the project would inexplicably start from scratch, walking away from the progress that had been made. Treasury confirmed that they understood this decision would likely foreclose delivery of Direct File by 2024, which, writing from the future where we know the results of the 2024 election, meant that Direct File would never have shipped.</p>
<p>It also didn’t help that the IRA required the IRS to produce a report on Direct File. At this point, no one had a plan for that report (apart from <a href="https://www.mitre.org">MITRE</a>, which assumed a lucrative contract would soon come their way). The optics of one part of government studying the question of Direct File while another part moved full steam ahead weren’t great. The eventual plan—delaying a decision on Direct File until May 2023 but producing another, more sophisticated prototype as part of the report work and thus preserving optionality (my favorite phrase)—was still a few months off. It turns out that tasking an agency to spend $15 million and nine months writing a report probably isn’t a great way to achieve a result, even if it worked in our case.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-saying-goodbye-3" id="fnref-saying-goodbye-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Starting over from square one, the IRS was not set up for success. As just one example, one of my top anxieties during this time was how Direct File would handle state taxes. I had written a four-page memo outlining the problem and five potential solutions, the whiz-kid designer had storyboarded out an early version of the experience that would eventually ship, and we had assembled a spreadsheet categorizing the filing options available in every state in the nation. Treasury’s July 2022 memo to the IRS, informing the IRS of its interest in pursuing Direct File, boiled all of this down to the single sentence, “It will be critical to determine the extent to which a federal filing tool can offer taxpayers an integrated way to file their state returns.” Helpful.</p>
<p>More than any memo, though, and even more than any prototype, what the IRS was deprived of was people. Because my <em>top</em> anxiety was: who is going to build Direct File? The IRS didn’t have the capacity to build a product like Direct File, which is not to say that the agency was incapable of it, just that it would take time and leadership to recruit and develop a team with the right combination of skills.</p>
<p>There aren’t very many user experience designers who understand tax law and can effectively collaborate with the IRS Office of Chief Counsel. For that matter, it’s also pretty difficult to find tax lawyers who know how to collaborate with designers. But we absolutely could find talented designers and talented lawyers and give them the space to learn from each other.</p>
<p>These problems can be hand-waved away if the plan is to outsource the work (this was the IRS’s preferred approach). Of course, that doesn’t solve the problem; it just makes it someone else’s problem. It doesn’t take a crystal ball to predict the steaming pile of crap taxpayers would have received after shelling out nine figures (cf. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/01/your-money/college-student-aid-fafsa.html">FAFSA</a>).</p>
<p>The work of growing a team ready for any challenge takes time and deliberate care. There are no shortcuts. What hurt us the most was not pausing the building of Direct File but abandoning the capacity to build we were cultivating.</p>
<hr>
<p>Our team was disbanded. A majority went to the Department of Education and helped launch the ill-fated student loan forgiveness application.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-saying-goodbye-4" id="fnref-saying-goodbye-4">[4]</a></sup> The loose-cannon engineer was assigned to a project that made him miserable, but where he would meet a couple of similarly miserable designers with whom he would share the dream of Direct File. Only Merici and I remained, advising Treasury on IRA implementation, hoping we might someday light the beacons and call the dream team back.</p>
<p>Three months later, with interest in Direct File on the rise, Treasury would reverse course and bring our team back to help pull off Direct File from within the IRS. I would be in charge of the team designing and building Direct File, and Merici would serve as deputy to the IRS executive who would run the Direct File program. That’s a story for another time, however. We lit the beacons, and the team returned. And then the team grew.</p>
<p>There were many moments in the course of the following year that I wished we had those three months back. We were comically past the ideal timeline I had laid out back in 2021, and we also now had to write a report to Congress. But regardless of whether this hiatus was death number two or three, it would be the last time Direct File died. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/irs-direct-file-tax-returns-free-trump-4bb0bca02fab9b3d06ae6f45ac67b7ab">Until this year</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve been continuously working in government, one way or another, since 2015. A few weeks ago, I resigned, as did the vast majority of the Direct File team. This time, it was even harder to say goodbye.</p>
<p>I do mourn the fact that Direct File won’t be available to taxpayers next year. But as I told the team as the end closed in, “We took a pipedream and made it a policy choice.” No one can claim with a straight face that Direct File is impossible anymore; bringing it back requires only that our elected leaders make a different choice.</p>
<p>What I mourn the most, though, is the dissolution of the team, the disregard for the vast impact they were poised and eager to deliver. The team itself is what I am proudest of from my time working on Direct File. Their manic dedication to the mission. The care they consistently took to get it right. The trust and love they had for each other.</p>
<p>One of the team’s many sayings was “the next version of Direct File is the best version of Direct File.” But just as Direct File constantly got better, so too did the team. We were growing our capacity to deliver for taxpayers each and every day, and we were helping to build new capacity across the IRS. Now that progress is interrupted, a reflection of progress interrupted across the federal government, of scientific research interrupted, of international aid interrupted, of all manner of interruptions.</p>
<p>Direct File is a policy choice, but the Direct File team was an orchard, just starting to produce a meaningful yield. Now it’s been razed.</p>
<p>We’ve documented what we learned. We’ve prepared the project for hibernation and written notes for a future team that might never come. We’ve <a href="/2025/05/direct-file-on-github/">open sourced</a> it for the world to see.</p>
<p>We’ve said goodbye.</p>
<hr>
<p>Except, well, a member of the team reviewed an early draft of this post, and she would like to refute this point, i.e. my title. According to her, the team has never said goodbye, only “ta ta for now.” We remain as delusional as ever. How else do you think Direct File happened?</p>
<p>It’s a peculiar sort of person who lives through the many deaths of Direct File and says, “Sign me up for one more, please.” But that’s the Direct File team for you. I dare you to try and stop them.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll be able to relight the beacons someday. And maybe this will be the last time Direct File dies.</p>

			<p>The IRS has now published <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file">the vast majority of Direct File’s code on GitHub</a> as open-source software. As a work of the U.S. government, Direct File is in the public domain. And now everyone can check it out.</p>
<p>Releasing Direct File’s source code demonstrates that the IRS is fulfilling its obligations under the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9566">SHARE IT Act</a> (three weeks ahead of schedule!). Now that Direct File has paved the way, I hope that more of the IRS’s code, paid for with taxpayer dollars, will soon be available to all of us.</p>
<p>Open sourcing Direct File has long been planned, and even longer desired. Explaining last May why open source is particularly important for Direct File, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5969.pdf">the team wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IRS could take further steps to build public trust and enable independent assessment of its work. The Direct File product team was given the mandate to develop software that ensures every taxpayer receives the full benefit of any tax provisions for which they are eligible. Releasing components of Direct File as open-source software would enable the team to demonstrate this commitment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Establishing trust with taxpayers was core to our approach for designing and building Direct File. By creating the most accurate option for filing, by making taxes accessible to all, by keeping taxpayer data secure, and now, by publicly sharing Direct File’s code, the Direct File team showed our dedication to earning taxpayers’ trust.</p>
<p><em>Please note: As of two weeks ago, I no longer work at the IRS. I am writing solely in my personal capacity.</em></p>

			<p>Andrew Leahey, for Forbes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It isn’t every day that the IRS drops something that reads like a blend of legal code, logic theory, and open government idealism. But that is exactly what it did, laying Direct File bare—and releasing it into the <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme">public domain</a>—for the world to scrutinize, fork, or admire in stunned silence.</p>
<p>At the heart of this code disclosure is something called the Fact Graph, a dry name for a tool that is quietly revolutionary: a logic engine that parses ambiguous tax scenarios and infers relationships while consistently applying tax rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first line of code for Direct File, written February 8, 2022, was for an experiment to explore the concepts that would become the Fact Graph. Even from that first experiment, the work was motivated by the need to establish trust with taxpayers. Direct File can ask hundreds of questions about your tax situation, but most users will see only a small fraction of that. The Fact Graph provides us with a means of proving that none of the unasked questions would have changed the bottom line of your tax return and that you’re getting every tax benefit to which you’re entitled.</p>
<p>The IRS has been working for years to develop a relatively simpler model of taxes, its “Tax Calculator” effort, which would model the relationships between the lines of the various tax forms. But Direct File and its Fact Graph go further by also tackling the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(telecommunications)">last mile</a> problem of taxes, the often fuzzy relationship between what gets entered on tax forms and the assorted facts about your life that inform what you’re eligible to claim, a relationship that’s variously described via statutes, regulations, court decisions, instructions, publications, and other guidance. This wasn’t trivial, as our team would often be teeing up novel questions for the IRS Office of Chief Counsel to consider as we sought to bring that ambiguity into sharp focus.</p>
<p>There’s ample prior art of knowledge graphs for taxes, but for me personally, the lineage of my thinking traces to a conversation with <a href="https://ben.klemens.org">Ben Klemens</a> at <a href="https://medium.com/civic-tech-thoughts-from-joshdata/what-happened-at-open-data-day-dc-2016-26fdbf9e40c2">Open Data Day 2016</a>, discussing his <a href="https://github.com/b-k/py1040">python script for doing his own taxes</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This all matters in an age when public trust in institutions is frayed and when algorithms, or artificial intelligence (AI), increasingly mediates our rights and obligations. If the tax code is going to be enforced by machines, and the preparation calculated and handled by the same, the rules those machines follow should be legible and contestable. The open-sourcing of Direct File hints at a future where regulatory logic and automated decision-making isn’t hidden, but published like case law—reviewable, revisable, and maybe even improved by the very public it serves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bingo.</p>

<p>In personal news, I’ve joined with our friends at the Economic Security Project to document and build upon the legacy of Direct File.</p>
<p>The Economic Security Project was one of the earliest and most effective advocates for Direct File, and throughout the program’s existence, they were a leader in getting the word out to the taxpayers who needed it the most.

<p>The tax code contains some pretty crazy edge cases that required a good amount of effort to build and test. Two of my favorite tax rules are the different ways to calculate whether the taxpayer was 65 or older during the tax year — people over 65 receive a greater standard deduction, but they also phase out of eligibility for EITC if they don’t have qualifying children. Confusingly, these rules use different definitions of what it means to be 65 during the tax year[…]</p>
<p>I wish that these edge cases were rare — but they’re all over the tax code (<a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/direct-file/backend/src/main/resources/tax/dependentsRelationship.xml#L986-L990">children who are not children</a>, <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/direct-file/backend/src/main/resources/tax/familyAndHousehold.xml#L2098-L2118">married couples filing jointly who don’t meet the Joint Return Test</a>, <a href="https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file/blob/main/direct-file/backend/src/main/resources/tax/familyAndHousehold.xml#L2532-L2547">people who can be claimed as a dependent who aren’t</a>, etc.). I feel confident that we represented these cases and gave the taxpayer every possible shot to file an accurate, beneficial return.</p>

			<p>So <a href="/2025/06/sittin-on-the-docket-at-va/">last week’s post</a> was not so subtly a provocation for the “just add AI” approach to government. But hey, now that I’ve already done the work of sussing out what’s going on and writing it out in detail, let’s add AI and see what happens.</p>
<p>I asked ChatGPT to read the post and suggest a few ways the algorithm could be improved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for sharing the post. It’s a rich and thoughtful deep dive into a real-world government algorithm with significant care and attention to fairness, complexity, and transparency. Still, even great systems can be improved. Here are several ways the algorithm might be enhanced or revisited, based on what the blog described.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh god, the sycophancy.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Reduce Reliance on Heuristics in Proportional Allocation</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current approach:</strong> The AMA algorithm uses fixed parameters like the <code>INTERPOLATED_DIRECT_REVIEW_PROPORTION_ADJUSTMENT</code> (e.g., 67%) and a <code>MAXIMUM_DIRECT_REVIEW_PROPORTION</code> cap (e.g., 80%).</li>
<li><strong>Suggested improvement:</strong> Replace static interpolation factors and hardcoded caps with dynamic, <strong>data-driven optimization</strong>. Techniques like Bayesian updating or reinforcement learning could help the system adapt in real time based on backlog levels, processing rates, and success in meeting deadlines.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Right off the bat, I think this provokes an interesting question. ChatGPT suggests a system that requires less human intervention because it optimizes itself toward a defined set of goals.</p>
<p>In the algorithm as I designed it, there are certainly examples of exactly this. You could imagine a version of the algorithm that preserved the concept of “docket month,” and allowed a human operator to specify how deep on the docket the machine was allowed to look, historically a policy decision that humans at the Board had been making. In this case, I opted to completely replace this process. Given the pace at which humans can orient and act upon new information, a process with a human in the loop would necessarily require a greater margin of error, and it was better for the algorithm to determine the most efficient possible parameter at any given time.</p>
<p>The same could be said for the parameters ChatGPT has called out above. Except that I think those items differ from the docket month example in terms of the pros and cons that must be weighed to change them. There is no right answer to whether the Board should prioritize Direct Reviews over legacy appeals.</p>
<p>These are policy questions in a complex decision space without an optimal answer. As I explained the algorithm to different audiences, one thing that I would always emphasize was that it provided “levers” that decision makers could pull. It wasn’t my place to decide those questions as the algorithm’s designer, as I would if I had obfuscated my opinions via an optimization function specified in a black box algorithm.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Implement Feedback Loops for Goal Reassessment</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current approach:</strong> The system assumes the 365-day goal for Direct Review decisions remains static, even when it becomes unrealistic.</li>
<li><strong>Suggested improvement:</strong> Introduce a <strong>feedback mechanism</strong> that automatically flags when a policy goal (like the 365-day target) is routinely being missed, and prompts a reassessment. This could be both internal (staff dashboards, alerts) and external (public transparency reports).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is right on, and actually prompted me to go back and add a note about the dashboard we built for this very purpose. (ChatGPT read an early draft; I was paranoid it might find some egregious error past me had made and thus undermine current me’s whole reason for writing.) But I like the suggestion that the data should be public.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Address Race Conditions in FIFO Distribution</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current approach:</strong> Race conditions can occur when two judges request cases simultaneously and might skip over the true “oldest” FIFO case.</li>
<li><strong>Suggested improvement:</strong> Introduce <strong>record-level locking</strong> or <strong>atomic fetch-and-assign</strong> mechanisms at the database level, even for legacy VACOLS records, possibly via a transactional wrapper layer or a temporary in-memory locking system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>My post flagged this as a theoretical problem, and yeah, it’s totally fixable. Caseflow already was using Redis; it wouldn’t have been hard to implement a locking mechanism. Heck, I added locking in Redis to my <a href="https://github.com/cmgiven/wtf-bot/blob/master/src/dictionary.rb#L145">Slackbot to look up acronyms</a>, which was nowhere near as mission critical. But the cost is adding complexity to the system, adding one more thing that could break. Given the negligible potential impact, I think I can defend letting that one go.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use Better Predictive Models for Case Inflow and Processing Time</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current approach:</strong> Direct Review pacesetting proportions and legacy NOD adjustments are based on historical averages (e.g., 40% of NODs becoming Form 9s).</li>
<li><strong>Suggested improvement:</strong> Use <strong>predictive analytics</strong> or machine learning to estimate case inflow and judge workload more precisely. For example:
<ul>
<li>Train models on NOD metadata to predict Form 9 likelihood.</li>
<li>Use survival analysis to forecast case readiness timelines.</li>
<li>Update predictions continuously based on actual outcomes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This one’s amusing to me. Once I finally got a VA computer (six weeks after I started work at VA), one of the first things I did was use survival analysis to model the appeals process end-to-end. Those models ended up having a ton of uses, both internal (workforce planning) and external (time estimates for Veterans checking their appeal’s status on VA.gov). ChatGPT would be proud. As for whether I should have plugged those models into the algorithm instead of the hardcoded 40% heuristic, nah, not worth the extra complexity.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>More Granular Customization of Batch Sizes</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The feature it turned out nobody needed? Yeah, not adding that. I guess I did call it a “disadvantage,” though, so that one’s on me.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>Improve Fairness Monitoring Across Judges</li>
<li>Add Resilience for Sudden Capacity Shifts</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are nice sounding words that mean nothing.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>Publish Algorithm Documentation and Code</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current approach:</strong> The algorithm used to be public but was removed from GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Suggested improvement:</strong> Restore the <strong>public repository</strong>, redacting any sensitive implementation details, to meet modern expectations for algorithmic transparency in government decision-making. This helps build trust and allows outside experts to contribute improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree completely.</p>

			<p>James R. McTigue, Jr.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IRS officials were unable to show us that they had independently documented measurable goals or objectives to manage the outcomes of its identity-proofing program. According to federal internal control standards, officials should define objectives clearly to enable the identification of risks and define risk tolerances. Without independently established measures and goals, IRS cannot determine whether the performance of ID.me’s solutions meets IRS needs.</p>
<p>Without goals or objectives set by IRS, it is also not clear which of the several measures that ID.me provides are the best matches for what IRS needs or what level of performance is appropriate for a given application. For example, ID.me’s true pass rate excludes both users who abandon the process and users identified as highly probable fraudulent. In establishing measurable goals, IRS could determine that information on such users are essential performance measures that need to be established. Furthermore, as IRS continues to expand online services that require identity proofing it will need to consider additional metrics for these services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point I’m going to write a long post about Direct File and identity. Today is not that day. But expect this report to be cited when I do.</p>
<p>GAO reports are pretty technical, and it’s understandable that some of the early takes I’ve seen kind of miss the mark. This is the key point: the IRS abdicated its responsibility to define what good looks like, outsourcing that responsibility to its vendor.</p>
