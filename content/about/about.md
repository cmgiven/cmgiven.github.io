# About

I'm a government technologist, which means sometimes I write code, and sometimes I write policy memos. Mostly I assemble teams of talented, dedicated people to build effective, accessible government services.

Between January 2021 and May 2025, I worked to make [IRS Direct File](https://directfile.irs.gov) a reality. More than 450,000 taxpayers filed their taxes for free, and they thought it was pretty great.

I've worked at about ten different federal agencies and for three state governments (if you include the District of Columbia, which you should).

I no longer work for the government, but I'll still note that all views expressed on this website are solely my own.
