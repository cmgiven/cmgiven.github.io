# About

I'm a government technologist, which means sometimes I write code, and sometimes I write policy memos. Mostly I assemble teams of talented, dedicated people to build effective, accessible government services.

I currently serve as the Deputy Secretary for Technology and Innovation of the [California Government Operations Agency](https://www.govops.ca.gov). All views expressed on this website are solely my own.

Before that, I led the team that designed and built [IRS Direct File](https://directfile.irs.gov). In total, I've worked for ten different federal agencies and four state governments. My bucket list remains far from complete, and I'm still hunting the elusive quadruply nested acronym.

He wears a dark button-down shirt, slacks, and sneakers. The building is in a neoclassical style, and the National Museum of Natural History is visible outside the window.">
