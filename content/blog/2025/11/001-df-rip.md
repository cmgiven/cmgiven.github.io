Direct File went live on January 29, 2024. It went dark on November 5, 2025.

The IRS is apparently tearing up its commitment that taxpayers would be able to access their data for three years. Now taxpayers' only options are to access a transcript online (basically a printout from the IRS mainframe) or to file [Form 4506](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506.pdf) and pay the IRS $30 to recreate a paper version of their return.

So that sucks. But I do want to memorialize the message that adorned the Direct File homepage for its final two weeks, ever since filing season ended:

> **Thank you, taxpayers.**
>
> Together, we created a free, simple way to file taxes.
>
> Over 500,000 of you used Direct File. Thousands of you gave us feedback. And hundreds of you joined our usability research sessions.
>
> We couldn't have done it without you.
