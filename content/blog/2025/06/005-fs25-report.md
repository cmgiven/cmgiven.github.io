Nina Olson and Gabriel Zucker:

> …the team continued to evaluate Direct File, as it had all along, preparing a comprehensive year-two report on its work. We filed a Freedom of Information Act request for that evaluation, and this week received Direct File’s 2025 season-end filing report. It tells an inspiring story of a product genuinely transforming tax administration in America, a story made bittersweet only by the fact that such progress has been cut short.

In addition to their [summary](https://taxpayer-rights.org/2025-direct-file-report/), the Center for Taxpayer Rights has posted the [full report](https://taxpayer-rights.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-14762.pdf) for all to read.
