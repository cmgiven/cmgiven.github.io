> Economic Security Project (ESP) announces a new fellowship focused on the future of tax filing, civic tech, and benefits equity. Launching in the wake of the Trump administration’s decision to sunset IRS Direct File—one of the most popular civic tech pilots in recent memory—this new initiative brings together technologists, policy experts, and equity-driven strategists to preserve hard-won progress and accelerate new ideas that make government work better for everyone.

In personal news, I've joined with our friends at the Economic Security Project to document and build upon the legacy of Direct File.

The Economic Security Project was one of the earliest and most effective advocates for Direct File, and throughout the program's existence, they were a leader in getting the word out to the taxpayers who needed it the most. I'm grateful for this opportunity to continue collaborating with Gabriel, Jen, and Merici, reflecting on what we learned and what work remains unfinished.
