> In a moment where machines churn out mediocrity, make something yourself. Make it imperfect. Make it rough. Just make it.

> At a time where the government's uncaring boot is pressing down on all of our necks, the best way to fight back is to care. Care loudly. Tell others. Get going.

At last week's [Code for America Summit](https://summit.codeforamerica.org), Suzanne Chapman and Katie Aloisi spoke about how Direct File was designed to build trust. Katie spent a significant portion of her time getting into the weeds of the tax situation of a fictional multi-generational household.

The audience wasn't bored. They were _riveted_. Suzanne and Katie's care was self-evident and contagious.

Caring is more than saying the right things. Care is shown.
