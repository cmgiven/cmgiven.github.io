> In the Who Cares Era, the most radical thing you can do is care.

> In a moment where machines churn out mediocrity, make something yourself. Make it imperfect. Make it rough. Just make it.

> At a time where the government's uncaring boot is pressing down on all of our necks, the best way to fight back is to care. Care loudly. Tell others. Get going.

At last week's [Code for America Summit](https://summit.codeforamerica.org), Suzanne Chapman and Katie Aloisi spoke about how Direct File was designed to build trust. Katie spent a significant portion of her time getting into the weeds of the tax situation of a fictional multi-generational household.

The audience wasn't bored. They were _riveted_. Suzanne and Katie's care was self-evident and contagious.

This was in contrast to an increasingly platitudinous atmosphere. The same recycled stories, making the same high-level points. And I generally agree with the points! But where the details haven't been completely glossed over, sometimes the speaker got them wrong.

I'm by no means innocent on this count. During a panel, I recited a story I've told many times before. But Dan's piece has been rattling around in my head as I think about how to approach writing in public for the first time in years.

Caring requires more than saying the right things. It requires more than telling someone, "I care." Care is shown.
